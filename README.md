# data engineering projects

### Hello, welcome to this repo! 

This is a repo for me to practice data engineering skills, so I'll keep updating my projects here. There are several skills that I'll focus on: (Actually, these are 10 core skills that my manager mentioned to me when I start my data engineer coop last year.)

- **API**: currently I only know how to interact with APIs as an individual, but what if we build our own APIs and then interact with vendors' APIs.
- **Web Scraping**: currently I did a project using BeautifulSoup and request packages to extract data from email and web links in Excel files. (not on GitHub) Also did a checkout bot to interact with some vendors to buy an item. **But for the next step, I may want to try some normal projects with BeautifulSoup or other packages to extact data**
- **SQL**: the best way to practice probably is doing leetcode problems? to get familiar with how to write the efficient queries in different cases. **But I would like to learn more about how to model data and the different database technologies(NO SQL, OLAP, OLTP)**
- **Cloud Application Development**: I used AWS s3 and redshift before, now my main focus is to learn how to connect aws with airflow or other applications. (try everything from the beginning) - update: almost done.
- **System Administration**: I don't have much to learn at this point. 
- **ETL**: probably for my main task now is to do several ETL projects and put them on github? to show my ability?haha **But after that, I would like to learn more about ETL design**
- **Data Structure and algorithms**: this is what i'm new to. Will take some courses to get familiar with. 
- **Devops**: learn how to write unit tests. In addition, I also want to learn how to write a config files instead of hard coding. Then CI/CD pipelines,etc. 
- **BI**: **I'll focus on it. how to visualize it. how to turn raw data into useful business metrics and KPIs. and also develop reporting to non-technical users.**
- **Communication**: this is the one skill that personally think I really need to improve. Be confident and express in a concise and clear way

#### Where to check projects:

1. **For ETL process**, projects are in dags folder, but due to the price of redshift, I haven't figured out how to show the load step.
