    "In the figure below we visualize our three exemplar kernels - polynomial, Fourier, and RBG - as similarity measures by fixing a point $\\mathbf{x}_i = \\begin{bmatrix}0.5 \\\\ 0.5 \\end{bmatrix}$ and plotting $\\mathbf{H}_{ij}$ over the range $\\mathbf{x}_j\\in\\left[0,1\\right]^{2}$, producing a color-coded surface showing how each kernel treats points near $\\mathbf{x}_{i}$.  Analyzing this Figure we can judge more generally how the three kernels define 'similarity' between points.  Firstly, we can see that a polynomial kernel treats data points $\\mathbf{x}_i$ and $\\mathbf{x}_j$ similarly if their inner product is high or, in other words, they highly correlate with each other. Likewise the points are treated as dissimilar when they are orthogonal to one another. On the other hand, the Fourier kernel treats points as similar if they lie close together, but their similarity differs like a “sinc” function as their distance from each other grows. Finally an RBF kernel provides a smooth similarity between points. If they are close to each other in a Euclidean sense they are highly similar; however, once the distance between them passes a certain threshold they are deemed rapidly dissimilar."
