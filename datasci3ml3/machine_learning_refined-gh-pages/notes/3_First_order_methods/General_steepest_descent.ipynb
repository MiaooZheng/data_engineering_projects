These variations arise out of a small but fundamental change to the gradient descent setup, a change that has significant impact on the form of a descent direction but importantly, not on the convergence of the methods (steepest descent methods converge under the same general condition as gradient descent, i.e., that the length of the steps eventually diminishes)."

Here we begin our discussion of steepest descent algorithms by re-visiting gradient descent and deriving the descent direction using a more rigorous mathematical framework. This framework immediately suggests a way to generalize the gradient descent algorithm under different *norms*, which we then explore."
