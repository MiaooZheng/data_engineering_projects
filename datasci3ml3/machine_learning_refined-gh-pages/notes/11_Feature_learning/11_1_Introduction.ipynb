    "Most (particularly modern) machine learning datasets have far more than two inputs, rendering visualization useless as a tool for feature engineering. But even in rare cases where data visualization is possible, we cannot simply rely on our own pattern recognition skills. Take the two toy datasets illustrated in [Figure 11.1](#figure-11-1) below, for example. The dataset on the left is a regression dataset with $N=1$ dimensional input and the one on the right is a two-class classification dataset with $N=2$ dimensional input. The true underlying nonlinear model used to generate the data in each case is shown in dashed black. We humans are typically taught only how to recognize the simplest of nonlinear patterns *by eye*, including those created by elementary functions (e.g., low degree polynomials, exponential functions, sine waves) and simple shapes (e.g., squares, circles, ellipses). Neither of the patterns shown in the Figure match such simple nonlinear functionalities. Thus, whether or not a dataset can be visualized, human engineering of proper nonlinear features can be difficult if not outright impossible."

    "The first step, as we will see in [Section 11.2](https://jermwatt.github.io/machine_learning_refined/notes/11_Feature_learning/11_2_Universal.html), is to organize the pursuit of automation by first placing the fundamental building blocks of this infinitude into *manageable collections* of (relatively simple) nonlinear functions. These collections are often called *universal approximators*, of which three strains are popularly used and which we introduce here: fixed-shape approximators, artificial neural networks, and trees.

This translates - formally speaking - into the the automatic determination of both the proper *form* of the general nonlinear model in Equation (1) above and the proper *parameter tuning* of this model regardless of training data and problem type.  We can think about this challenge metaphorically as 1) the *construction* of and 2) the *automatic setting* of a *complexity dial*, like the one illustrated pictorially in [Figure 11.2](#figure-11-2) for a simple nonlinear regression dataset, that allows us to properly *learn* the appropriate features for *any dataset* regardless of problem type.  In other words, the 'complexity dial' conceptualization of feature learning visually depicts the challenge of feature learning at a high level as a dial that must be built and automatically tuned to determine the appropriate amount of model complexity needed to represent the phenomenon generating a generic training dataset.

    "Setting this complexity dial all the way to the left corresponds, generally speaking, to choosing a simple form for the nonlinear model that results in a representation of low complexity (e.g., a linear model, as depicted visually in the Figure).  As the dial is turned from left to right various models of increasing complexity are tried against the training data.  If turned too far to the right the resulting model will be too complex (or too 'wiggly') with respect to the training data (as depicted visually in the two small panels on the right side of the dial).   When set 'just right' (as depicted visually in the small image atop the complexity dial that is second to the left) the resulting model represents the data - as the underlying phenomenon generating it - very well.
