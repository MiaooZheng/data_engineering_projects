While in principle any universal approximator can be used with boosting, this approach is often used as the cross-validation method of choice when employing tree-based universal approximators (as discussed further in Section 14.2)."

    "Using the capacity/optimization dial conceptualization first introduced in Section 11.2.4, we can think about boosting as starting with our *capacity dial* set all the way to the *right* at some high value (e.g., some large value of $M$), and fidgeting with the *optimization dial* by turning it very slowly from left to right starting at the far left (as depicted in the bottom row of Figure 11.15).  As discussed in Section 11.3.2 and summarized visually in the bottom row of Figure 11.25, with real data this general configuration (setting the capacity dial to the right, and adjusting optimization dial) allows our *optimization dial* to (roughly speaking) govern the complexity of a tuned model based on how well we optimize (the more we optimize a high capacity model the higher its complexity with respect to the training data becomes).  In other words with this configuration our optimization dial (roughly speaking) becomes the sort of fine resolution *complexity* dial we aimed to construct at the outset of the Chapter (see Section 11.1).  With our optimization dial turned all the way to the left we begin our search with a low complexity tuned model (called $\\text{model}_1$) consisting of a single unit of a universal approximator having its parameters fully optimized.  As we progress through rounds of boosting we turn the optimization dial gradually from left to right (here each notch on the optimization dial denotes the complete optimization of one additional unit) optimizing (to completion) a single weighted unit of our original high capacity model, so that at the $m^{th}$ round our tuned model (called $\\text{model}_m$) consists of $m$ individually but fully tuned units.

    "Whether we use fixed-shape, neural network, or tree-based units with boosting we will naturally prefer units with *low capacity* so that the resolution of our model search is as fine-grained as possible. When we start adding units one-at-a-time we turn our optimization dial clockwise from left to right.  We want this dial turning to be done as smoothly as possible so that we can determine the lowest validation error model as accurately as possible. This is depicted in the left panel of [Figure 11.33](#figure-11-33). If we used *high capacity* units at each round of boosting the resulting model search will be much coarser, as adding each additional unit results in aggressively turning the dial from left to right leaving large gaps in our model search, as depicted in the right panel of [Figure 11.33](#figure-11-33).   This kind of low resolution search could easily result in us skipping over the complexity of an optimal model.  The same can be said as to why we add only one unit at-a-time with boosting, tuning its parameters alone at each round. If we added more than one unit at-a-time, or if we re-tuned *every* parameter of *every* unit at each step of this process not only would we have significantly more computation to perform at each step but the performance difference between subsequent models could be quite large and we might easily miss out on an ideal model."

Indeed principally the two approaches are entirely similar, except with boosting we do not select from a set of given input features but create them ourselves based on a chosen universal approximator family. Additionally, unlike feature selection where our main concern is *human interpret-ability*, we primarily use boosting as a tool for cross-validation. This means that unless we specifically prohibit it from occurring, we can indeed select the same feature multiple times in the boosting process as long as it contributes positively towards finding a model with minimal validation error.\n",

    "selecting an appropriate number of features, with human interpretation of the resulting selected features still in mind. On the other hand, rarely is feature selection done when employing a nonlinear model based on features from a universal approximator due to the great difficulty in the human interpret-ability of nonlinear features. The rare exception to this rule is when using tree-based units which, due to their simple structure, can in particular instances be readily interpreted by humans."
