    "Validation error provides us with a concrete way of not only measuring the performance of a single tuned model, but more importantly it allows us to compare the efficacy of multiple tuned models of various levels of complexity.  By carefully searching through a set of models ranging in complexity we can then easily identify the best of the bunch, the one that provides minimal error on the validation set. This comparison of models, called *cross-validation* or sometimes *model search* or *selection*, is the basis of feature learning as it provides a systematic way to *learn* (as opposed to *engineer*, as detailed in Chapter 10) the proper form a nonlinear model should take for a given dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Section we introduce what we refer to as *naive* cross-validation.  This consists of a search over a set of models of *varying capacity*, with each model fully optimized over the training set, in search of a validation error-minimizing choice.   While it is simple in principle and in implementation, naive cross-validation is generally speaking very expensive (computationally speaking) and often results in a rather *coarse* model search that can miss (or 'skip over') the ideal amount of complexity desired for a given dataset.

    "In the top panel of [Figure 11.28](#11.28) we show the generic sort of training (in blue) and validation (in yellow) errors we find in practice as a result of following this naive cross-validation scheme. The horizontal axis of this plot shows (roughly speaking) the complexity of each of our $M$ *fully optimized* models, with the output on the vertical axis denoting error level.  As can be seen in the Figure, our low complexity models *underfit* the data as reflected in their high training and validation errors. As the model complexity increases further, fully optimized models achieve lower training error since increasing model complexity allows us to constantly improve how well we can represent training data. This fact is reflected in the monotonically decreasing nature of the (blue) training error curve. On the other hand, while the validation error of our models will tend to decrease at first as we increase complexity, this trend continues only up to a point where *overfitting* of the training data begins. Once we reach a model complexity that overfits the training data our validation error starts to increase again, as our model becomes less and less a fair representation of \"data we might receive in the future\" generated by the same phenomenon.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note in practice that while training error typically follows the monotonically decreasing trend shown in the top panel of Figure 11.28, validation error can oscillate up and down more than once depending on the models tested.  In any event, we determine the best fully optimized model from the set by choosing the one that *minimizes* validation error.  This is often referred to as solving the *bias-variance trade-off*, as it involves determining a model that (ideally) neither underfits (or has high bias) nor overfits (or has high variance). \n",

Here we set our *optimization* dial all the way to the right - indicating that we optimize every model to completion - and in ranging over our set of $M$ models we turn the *capacity* dial from left to right starting with $m=1$ (on the left) and ending with $m=M$ (all the way to the right - with the value of $m$ increasing by $1$ at each notch of the dial).  Since in this case the *capacity* dial roughly governs model complexity - as summarized visually in the bottom row of Figure 11.24 -  our model search reduces to setting this dial correctly to the minimum validation error setting.  To visually denote how this is done we wrap the prototypical validation error curve shown in the top panel of [Figure 11.28](#figure-11-28) clockwise around the capacity dial.  We can then imagine setting this dial correctly (and automatically) to the value of $m$ providing minimum validation error."

    "Naive cross-validation works reasonably well for simple examples like those described above, and is cheap computationally speaking.  However since the process generally involves trying out a range of models - whether it be an organized set consisting of models that monotonically increase in capacity / number of units or some more general collection of models - where each model is *optimized completely*, naive cross-validation can be very expensive computationally speaking.  Moreover, the *capacity* difference between even adjacent models (e.g., those consisting of $m$ and $m+1$ units) can be quite large - even if *low capacity* units are used (as each additional unit 'adds an additional dimension' to the span of the model - as illustrated conceptually in Figure 11.7).  While there are certainly special cases when the capacity of a set of models can be controlled *smoothly*, typically since each model is fully optimized this can lead to huge jumps in the range of model complexities tried out on a dataset.  In other words naive cross-validation often leads to a very *coarse* range of model complexities that can 'miss out' on an ideal amount of nonlinearity for a given dataset.  \n",

    "This general 'coarse search resolution' problem is illustrated conceptually in [Figure 11.31](#figure-11-31).  Controlling model complexity search via adjustment of the *capacity* dial (with our optimization dial turned all the way to the right - as depicted in the bottom panels of [Figure 11.31](#figure-11-31) often only allows for a *coarse* model search that can easily 'skip over' an ideal amount of (validation error minimizing) model complexity.  In short, generally speaking, performing model search via the adjustment of the *capacity dial* is expensive and results in a coarse search for validation error minimizing complexity.  As we will see in the next two Sections, much more robust and fine-grained cross-validation schemes can be constructed by setting our *capacity dial* to the right and controlling model *complexity* by carefully setting our *optimization dial*."
