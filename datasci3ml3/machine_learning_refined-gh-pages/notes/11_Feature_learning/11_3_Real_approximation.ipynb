    "In the previous Section we saw how a nonlinear model built from units of a single universal approximator can be made to tightly approximate any *perfect dataset* if we increase its capacity sufficiently and tune the model's parameters properly by minimizing an appropriate cost function. In this Section we will investigate how universal approximation carries over to the case of *real data*, i.e., data that is finite in size and potentially noisy. We will then learn about a new measurement tool, called *validation error*, that will allow us to effectively employ universal approximators with real data. "

Notice how, with each of the universal approximators, all three models *underfit* the data when using only $B = 1$ unit in each case. This underfitting of the data is a direct consequence of using low capacity models which produce fits that are not *complex* enough for the underlying data they are aiming to approximate. Also notice how each model improves as we increase $B$, but only up to a certain point after which each *tuned* model becomes far too complex and starts to look rather wild, and very much unlike the sinusoidal phenomenon that originally generated the data. This is especially visible in the polynomial and neural network cases, where by the time we reach $B = 20$ units both models are extremely oscillatory and far too complex. Such *overfitting* models while representing the current data well, will clearly make for poor predictors of future data generated by the same process. "

After that and up to a certain point the decision boundary provided by each model improves as more units are added, with $B = 5$ polynomial units, $B = 3$ $\\text{tanh}$ units, and $B = 5$ stump units providing reasonable approximations to the desired circular decision boundary. However soon after we reach these numbers of units each tuned model becomes too complex and *overfits* the training data, with the decision boundary of each drifting away from the circular boundary centered at the origin that would properly predict the labels of future data generated by the same underlying phenomenon.

Notice, we only control the *complexity* of a tuned model (or, roughly speaking, how \"wiggly\" a tuned model fit is) *indirectly* by how we set both our capacity and optimization dials, and it is not obvious *a priori* how we should set them simultaneously in order to achieve the right amount of model complexity for a given dataset.  However, we can make this dial-tuning problem somewhat easier by fixing one of the two dials and adjusting only the other.  Setting one dial all the way to the right imbues the other dial with the sole control over the complexity of a tuned model (and turns it into - roughly speaking - the *complexity dial* described in Section 11.1).  That is, fixing one of the two dials all the way to the right, as we turn the unfixed dial from left to right we increase the complexity of our final tuned model.  This is a general principle when applying universal approximator-based models to real data that does not present itself in the case of perfect data."

We say that such a tuned model *underfits*, as it does not even fit the given data well.  Notice that while the simple visual depiction here illustrates an underfitting model as a linear ('un-wiggly') function - which is quite common in practice - it is possible for an underfitting model to be quite 'wiggly'.  Regardless of the 'shape' a tuned model takes we say that it underfits if it poorly represents the training data - i.e., if it has high training error.\n",

Indeed past this point, where the complexity of each tuned model is wildly inappropriate for the phenomenon at play, we say that *overfitting* begins. This language is used because while such highly complex models fit the given data extremely well, they do so at the cost of not representing the underlying phenomenon well. As we continue to turn our capacity dial to the right the resulting tuned models will become increasingly complex and increasingly less representative of the true underlying phenomenon.  "

    "How we set our capacity and optimization dials in order to achieve a final tuned model that has *just the right amount of complexity* for a given dataset is the main challenge we face when employing universal approximator-based models with real data. In Examples 11.7 and 11.8 we saw how training error fails to indicate when a tuned model has sufficient *complexity* for the tasks of regression and two-class classification respectively, a fact more generally true about all nonlinear machine learning problems as well. If we cannot rely on training error to help decide on the proper amount of complexity required to address real nonlinear machine learning tasks, what sort of measurement tool should we use instead? Closely examining [Figure 11.26](#figure-11-26) reveals the answer! \n",

    "In the top row of this Figure we show three instances of models presented for the toy regression dataset in Example 11.6: a fully tuned low complexity (and underfitting) linear model in the left panel, a high complexity (and overfitting) degree $20$ polynomial model in the middle panel, and a degree $3$ polynomial model in the right panel that fits the data and the underlying phenomenon generating it \"just right.\" What do both the underfitting and overfitting patterns have in common, that the \"just right\" model does not?\n",
    "\n",
    "Scanning the left two panels of the Figure we can see that a common \n",
    "problem with both the underfitting and overfitting models is that, while they differ in how well they represent data *we already have*, they will both fail to adequately represent *new data* generated via the same process by which the current data was made. In other words, we would not trust either model to predict the output of a newly arrived input point. The \"just right\" fully tuned model does not suffer from the same problem as it closely approximates the sort of wavy sinusoidal pattern underlying the data, and as a result would work well as a predictor for future data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same story tells itself in the bottom row of the Figure with our two-class classification dataset used previously in Example 11.7. Here we show a fully tuned low complexity (and underfitting) linear model in the left panel, a high complexity (and overfitting) degree $20$ polynomial model in the middle panel, and \"just right\" degree $2$ polynomial model in the right panel.

    "In summary, with both the simple regression and classification examples discussed here we can roughly qualify poorly performing models as those that will not allow us to make accurate predictions of data we will receive in the future. But how do we quantify something we will receive in the future? We address this next."

To make this notion useful we need to translate it into a quantity we can always measure, regardless of the dataset/problem we are tackling or the kind of model we employ.\n",

In other words, we cut out a random chunk of the dataset we have, train our selection of models on only the portion of data that remains, and *validate* the performance of each model on this randomly removed chunk of \"new\" data. The random portion of the data we remove to validate our model(s) is commonly called the *validation data*  (or validation set), and the remaining portion we use to train models is likewise referred to as the *training data* (or training set). The model providing the lowest error on the validation data, i.e., the *lowest validation error*, is then deemed the best choice from a selection of trained models. As we will see validation error (unlike training error) is in fact a proper measurement tool for determining the quality of a model against the underlying data generating phenomenon we want to capture."

    "There is no precise rule for what portion of a given dataset should be saved for validation. In practice, typically between $\\frac{1}{10}$ to $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the data is assigned to the validation set. Generally speaking, the larger and/or more representative (of the true phenomenon from which the data is sampled) a dataset is the larger the portion of the original data may be assigned to the validation set (e.g., $\\frac{1}{3}$). The intuition for doing this is that if the data is plentiful/representative enough, the training set still accurately represents the underlying phenomenon even after removal of a relatively large set of validation data. Conversely, in general with smaller or less representative (i.e., more noisy or poorly distributed) datasets we usually take a smaller portion for validation (e.g., $\\frac{1}{10}$) since the relatively larger training set needs to retain what little information of the underlying phenomenon was captured by the original data, and little data can be spared for validation."
