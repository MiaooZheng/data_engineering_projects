    "As we discussed in detail in [Section 11.4](https://jermwatt.github.io/machine_learning_refined/notes/11_Feature_learning/11_4_Cross_validation.html), validation data is the portion of our original dataset  we exclude at random from the training process in order to determine a proper tuned model that will faithfully represent the phenomenon generating our data.  The validation error generated by\n",
    "our tuned model on this 'unseen' portion of data is the fundamental measurement tool we use to determine an appropriate cross-validated model for our entire dataset (besides, perhaps, a testing set - see Section 11.7).

    "training and validation portions which are not desirable representatives of the underlying phenomenon that generated them?  In other words, in practice what do we do about potentially bad training-validation splits, which can result in poorly representative cross-validated models?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Because we *need* cross-validation in order to choose appropriate models in general, and because we can do nothing about the (random) *nature* by which we split our data for cross-validation (what better is there to simulate the 'future' of our phenomenon?), the practical solution to this fundamental problem is to simply perform several different training-validation splits, determine an appropriate cross-validated model on each split, and then *average* the resulting cross-validated models.  By averaging a set of cross-validated models, also referred to as *bagging* in the jargon of machine learning, we can *very often* both 'average out' the potentially undesirable characteristics of each model while synergizing their positive attributes (that is, while bagging is not mathematically guaranteed to produce a more effective model than any of the members averaged to create it - e.g., when all but one cross-validated model provide poor results leading to an average of mostly bad predictors - typically in practice it produces superior results).  Moreover, with *bagging* we can also effectively combine cross-validated models built from *different universal approximators*.  Indeed this is the most reasonable way of creating a single model built from different types of universal approximators in practice. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will walk through the concept of bagging or model averaging for regression, as well as two-class and multi-class classification by exploring an array of simple examples.  With these simple examples we will illustrate the superior performance of bagged models visually, but in general we confirm this using the notion of testing error (see Section 11.7) or an estimate of testing error (often employed when bagging trees - see Section 14.6).  Regardless, the principles detailed here can be employed more widely as well to any machine learning problem.   As we will see, the best way to average/bag a set of cross-validated regression models is by taking their *median* and cross-validated classification models by computing the *mode* of their predicted labels."

Like other important parameters involved with cross-validation (e.g., the portion of a dataset to reserve for validation) there is in general no magic number (of cross-validated models) used generally in practice for bagging.  Ideally if we knew that any random validation portion of a dataset generally represented it well, which is often true with very large datasets, there would be less of a need to ensemble multiple cross-validated models where each was trained on a different training/validation split of the original data, since we could trust the results of a single cross-validated model more.  Indeed in such instances we could instead bag a range of models trained on a single training/validation split in order to achieve similar improvements over a single model.   On the other hand, the less we could trust in the faithfulness of a random validation portion to represents a phenomenon at large, the less we could trust an individual cross-validated model and hence we might wish to ensemble more of them to help average our poorly performing models resulting from bad splits of the data.  Since this is generally impossible to determine in practice often practical considerations (e.g., computation power, dataset size) determine if bagging is used and if so how many models are employed in the average."

On the other hand with bagging (as we have seen) we  *average* together *multiple cross-validated* models that have been trained *independently* of each other.
